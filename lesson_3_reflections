When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use it, if I were working with more people.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually is better than automatic, because if i chose pulling automatically i can get unnessesary stuff
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
FORK- for clone from other account on GitHUB on my GITHUB
CLONE for clone copy form other computer or GitHUB and for making some changes
Branches for my local projects, checking something new,and risky
