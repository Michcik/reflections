What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: U can make it more understandly for yourself, and its working offline. You don't make save, when u don't need tooor you make error.
Cons:It could happen that u miss something.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I think that because, Git was created for programmists, and saving mutiple files once is very usefull.
